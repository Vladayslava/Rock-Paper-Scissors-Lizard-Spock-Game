# Game rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock

The "Game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" project is a modern twist on the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, enhanced with new elements and strategies. Our goal is to develop an online game for mobile devices. We are currently testing an offline mode to get feedback from players and improve the user experience.
The target audience for this project includes children, teenagers, and adults looking for an enjoyable pastime, as well as teachers and parents seeking to offer an educational activity to their wards.
